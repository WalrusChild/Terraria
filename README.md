- Time plugin - Can set specific time.
- InstaKill plugin - Spawns a projectile at your cursor that will instakill most creatures in Terraria. X key default.
- Summon plugin - Spawn in any enemy using this list of IDs https://terraria.gamepedia.com/NPC_IDs

# How do I use these?
These files are plugins for a program called TerrariaPatcher that can be found here.

You can use them by adding the \*.cs files to the Plugins folder.
