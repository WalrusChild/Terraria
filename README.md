# What is this place?!
Here are a couple TerrariaPatcher plugins that I have been working on.

# Features
The current plugins consist of:
- Heal plugin
- Weather change plugin
- Time plugin (can set specific time)

I will be adding more in the future, so stay tuned!

# How do I use these?
These files are plugins for a program called TerrariaPatcher that can be found here.

You can use them by adding the \*.cs files to the Plugins folder. 

# About
I am just here to have fun and share my experimentation/creation with people.

Since January 2018.
